I believe this course will help me in two ways. Firstly, it will help me get hands-on practice coding machine learning algorithms in Python, and since true understanding only comes from doing, the coding exercises are a great way to make sure I really understand the concepts. Secondly, it will give me a thorough conceptual understanding of the concepts I need to grasp the workings behind machine learning. It will help me grasp both the intuition and underlying math, and understand why the things that work, really do work. I also aim to leverage the learning in this course in my future endeavors.  This knowledge gained in this course will help me better understand advanced topics like large language models, which I aim to learn more about and ultimately work on in a telecom and 6G context for my thesis project. In summary, this course will set me on my way to learn what I need for my final year project.
